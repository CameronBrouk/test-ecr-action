# TODO

1. Create github actions file that pushes the code to ECR
2. Make the dockerfile more efficient / use better practices

- use more specific base image
- cache package.json for each build

## Notes

- You can use 'docker build' to push an image to a url/repository(this is probably how the ecr thing will work)
